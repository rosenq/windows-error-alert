# windows-error-alert
log windows error alerts to txt, log, xls, or sql.

purpose: script to log windows os errors to a file or database.  
initial reason: tired of spot checking for issues on servers at work.  
tool: visual studio, c#
notes: first c# app, minimal skill with vb.net prior. good luck, me.
